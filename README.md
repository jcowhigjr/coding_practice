I am using this to document some coding challenges.

# Open a PR with the new or refactored challenge

Github CI will run the tests with rake.

Locally to play along ...

Install bundler if necessary

    gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc

Edit `Gemfile` to use the correct gems for your platform (optional).

Use bundler to install the gems.

    bundle

Rename `my_kata.rb` and `test_my_kata.rb` and edit `test_my_kata.rb` to require
the correct file for your kata, i.e. whatever you renamed `my_kata.rb` to.

Start guard to run your tests automatically.

    guard

Do your kata! Guard will monitor your files and run your tests automatically
whenever you make a change.
